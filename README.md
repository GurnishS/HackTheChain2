# FIR-Chain: Blockchain-based Secure Storage for First Investigation Reports




## Problem:
India’s digitalization has led to a shift from traditional manual systems to a centralized online process for registering complaints, but the security of the First Information Report (FIR) system remains a critical concern. This project proposes a solution that leverages blockchain technology to enhance the security of FIRs, addressing the need for a more secure, traceable, and chronological record-keeping system.
